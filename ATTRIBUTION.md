## ðŸ“£ Model & Acknowledgements

This project uses the **YOLOv8 pothole/road-damage segmentation model** provided by Farzad Nekouee in the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/FarzadNekouee/YOLOv8_Pothole_Segmentation_Road_Damage_Assessment
```

The pretrained model from that repository (`model/best.pt`) is used here to detect potholes and damage masks, which feed into the heatmap and path-planning logic.  
A big thanks to the author for releasing this model â€” it made the pothole detection pipeline much easier to integrate.
